# Mechvibes

Made Some UI Changes to the original [Mechvibes](https://github.com/hainguyents13/mechvibes) app.

- You can add more keyboard sound set by recording any sound you like and add them to this app with some easy steps.

- Use your laptop keyboard or non-mechanical keyboard at work and still hear your loved sound.

- Use this app as any purpose as you want (such as demo for the buyer about the keyboard sound before they buy it, custom any sound for any key...)

With Mechvibes Editor, you can create a new sound pack, edit existing sound pack or share them with your friends.

### How to use

- Download it from [Releases](https://github.com/DewanshNehra/mechvibes/releases/latest)
- Run it.
- Enjoy it.

### Issues
